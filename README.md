# unsupervised_learning_nfl_wine" 

For full analysis, please see the pdf in the current repository.

The basics gist of the code is to compare unsupervised learning algorithms against Red Wine and NFL statistics to determine quality and wins respectively.

This is for GATech's Graduate Machine Learning class, assignment 3

Below is the information needed to run.

## Prerequisites:

R, version 3.2.5

with the following libraries:
dplyr
caret
nFactor
fastICA
e1071
ggplot2
fpc
MASS
flexclust
mclust
scatterplot3d
ggplot2
dplyr
reshape
MASS
nnet

## Obtaining data

Data can be downloaded automatically from the website.

In the wine.R and nfl.R files, uncomment out the code at the top of the file to download.

However, to save time, those files are included in this tar file.

## Running
The main R file should run as is.

However, it will be very slow and take a long time.  This should be run function by function.  The code is commented so that each part of the problem can be run independtly.  

In addition, the plots are not saved.  Saving the plots is a manual process for the user.
